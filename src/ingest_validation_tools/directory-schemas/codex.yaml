# A dataset consists of a single CODEX experimental run, and is 
# collected by the Akoya software into a single directory. 
#
# directory beginning with drv_ contains analyzed files produced. 
# There are a few files in this directory that are used for the HuBMAP 
# data processing pipelines (channelNames.txt, experiment.json, segmentation.json)
#
# directory beginning with src_ contains the raw (unprocessed by Akoya) files.
