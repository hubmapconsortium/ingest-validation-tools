  -
    pattern: raw\/images\/overlay\.(?:jpeg|tiff)
    required: False
    description: State whether an overlay image was used to guide ROI selection. If an overlay is used, then the overlay details will be provided in the protocols.io protocol. If used, this needs to be uploaded. It is not included in the OME TIFF. This can be a JPEG or TIFF file

This file contains one row per AOI/segment and no analyses span AOI. The AOIs included in this file can come from different GeoMx runs and hence span Globus uploads. So care must be taken to make sure the appropriate AOIs are included in the file.
