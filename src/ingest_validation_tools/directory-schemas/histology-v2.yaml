    pattern: microscope_settings\.json
    required: False
    description: A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the settings that were used to acquire the image data. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document.
    is_qa_qc: True

    pattern: extras\/.*
    required: True
    description: Folder for general lab-specific files related to the dataset. [Exists in all assays]
  -
    pattern: raw\/.*
    required: True
    description: Raw data files for the experiment.
  -  
    pattern: raw\/images\/.*
    required: True
    description: Raw image files. Using this subdirectory allows for harmonization with other more complex assays, like Visium that includes both raw imaging and sequencing data. [This directory must include at least one raw file.] 
  -
    pattern: raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.xml
    required: True
    description: XML metadata file from the autofluorescence microscopy experiments
    is_qa_qc: False
  -
    pattern: raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.(?:scn|vsi|ndpi|svs|czi|tiff)
    required: True
    description: Raw microscope file for the experiment
    is_qa_qc: False
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/.*
    required: True
    description: Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data.
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/images\/.*
    required: True
    description: Processed image files
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff
    required: True
    description: OME-TIFF files (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the microscopy experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. [HuBMAP ID should be prepended to file name.]
    is_qa_qc: False
    example: lab_processed/images/HBM892.MDXS.293.ome.tiff
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome-tiff\.channels\.csv
    required: True
    description: This file should describe any processing that was done to generate the images in each channel of the accommpanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel and the first field should be the number of the channel.
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/transformations\/.*
    required: False
    description: This directory contains transformation matrices that capture how each modality is aligned with the other and can be used to visualize overlays of multimodal data. This is needed to overlay images from the exact same tissue section (e.g., MALDI imaging mass spec, autofluorescence microscopy, MxIF, histological stains). In these cases data type may have different pixel sizes and slightly different orientations (i.e., one may be rotated relative to another).
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/transformations\/[^\/]+transformations\.txt
    required: False
    description: Transformation matrices used to overlay images from the exact same tissue section (e.g., MALDI imaging mass spec, autofluorescence microscopy, MxIF, histological stains). 
    is_qa_qc: False
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/annotations\/.*
    required: False
    description: Directory containing annotations
    dependency: segmentation-masks-v2
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/probabilities\/.*
    required: False
    description: Directory containing probabilities pertaining to lab processed data (e.g., from Ilastik pixel classification).
  -
    pattern: lab_processed\/probabilities\/[^\/]+\.tiff
    required: False
    description: A TIFF file that contains pixel probabilities.
