# Questions for reviewers:
# - A dataset consists of multiple libraries? Or just a single one?
#   (ie, multiple "alignment"/"barcode_matching" pairs, or just one?)
# - The example has structure in the filenames that we aren't validating.
#   Ok, or should we be more strict?
# - While it's certainly legal to mix upper and lower case letters in filenames,
#   there are differences between OSs, and it can be a headache. Can we nudge
#   for the names to be all lower-case?
