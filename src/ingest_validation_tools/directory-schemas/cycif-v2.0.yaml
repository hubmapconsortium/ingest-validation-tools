    required: True
    description: This is a directory containing raw data.
  -  
    pattern: raw\/images\/.*
    required: True
    description: Raw image files. Using this subdirectory allows for harmonization with other more complex assays, like Visium that includes both raw imaging and sequencing data.

    pattern: raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.czi$
    required: True
    description: Raw image file in CZI format

    pattern: lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.(?:tif|tiff)$
    required: True
    description: OME-TIFF file (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0> It is recommended that you confirm you're using the latest version of Bio-Formats, when generating the OME TIFF, as newer versions have improved XML handling.

    required: True
    description: This file provides essential documentation pertaining to each channel of the accommpanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel.

    pattern: lab_processed\/transformations\/.*
    required: False
    description: This directory contains transformation matrices that capture how each modality is aligned with the other and can be used to visualize overlays of multimodal data. This is needed to overlay images from the exact same tissue section (e.g., MALDI imaging mass spec, autofluorescence microscopy, MxIF, histological stains). In these cases data type may have different pixel sizes and slightly different orientations (i.e., one may be rotated relative to another).
