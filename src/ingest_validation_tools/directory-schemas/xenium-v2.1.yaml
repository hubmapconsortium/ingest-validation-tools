    pattern: raw\/images\/overlay\.(?:jpeg|tiff)
    required: False
    description: State whether an overlay image was used to guide ROI selection. If an overlay is used, then the overlay details will be provided in the protocols.io protocol. If used, this needs to be uploaded. It is not included in the OME TIFF. This can be a JPEG or TIFF file
