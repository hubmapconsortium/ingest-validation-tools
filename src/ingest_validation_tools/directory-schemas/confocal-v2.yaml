    required: False
    description: This directory contains transformation matrices that capture how each modality is aligned with the other and can be used to visualize overlays of multimodal data. This is needed to overlay images from the exact same tissue section (e.g., MALDI imaging mass spec, autofluorescence microscopy, MxIF, histological stains). In these cases data type may have different pixel sizes and slightly different orientations (i.e., one may be rotated relative to another).
