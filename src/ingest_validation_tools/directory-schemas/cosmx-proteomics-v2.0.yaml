    description: Cell metadata file containing the following information - the origin of the cell (fov, unique cell id); physical properties of the cell (area, aspect ratio, width, height); location of the cell centroid within each FOV (center X/Y local) and global position (center X/Y global); information about the protein staining (min/max intensity); type of protein, which may be specific to each experiment but generally includes DAPI, Membrane, PanCK, CD45; other (e.g. Seurat information if that pipeline was used within AtoMx, some data quality information)
  -
    pattern: raw\/markers\.csv$

  -
    pattern: raw\/additional_panels_used\.csv$
    required: False
    description: 'If multiple commercial probe panels were used, then the primary probe panel should be selected in the "oligo_probe_panel" metadata field. The additional panels must be included in this file. Each panel record should include: manufacturer, model/name, product code.'
  -
    pattern: raw\/custom_probe_set\.csv$
    required: False
    description: 'This file should contain any custom probes used and must be included if the metadata field "is_custom_probes_used" is "Yes". The file should minimally include: target gene id, probe seq, probe id. The contents of this file are modeled after the 10x Genomics probe set file (see <https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/probe-sets/probe-set-file-descriptions/probe-set-file-descriptions#probe_set_csv_file>).'
