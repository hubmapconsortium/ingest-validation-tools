    name: channel_id
    description: The cycle/channel in which the protein was assessed with this antibody. For example, an experiment that involves 3 hybridization cycles & 4 signal detection channels would have **channel_id**s numbered 1-12. Antibodies detected with channel 1 would have **channel_id** 1,5 & 9. Antibodies detected with channel 2 would have **channel_id** 2,6 & 10 and so on for the remaining antibodies.
