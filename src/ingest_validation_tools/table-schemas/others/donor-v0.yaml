    The Kidney Donor Profle Index (KDPI) is a numerical measure that combines ten donor factors,
    including clinical parameters and demographics,
    to summarize into a single number the quality of deceased donor kidneys relative to other recovered kidneys.
    The KDPI is derived by frst calculating the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) for a deceased donor.
    Kidneys from a donor with a KDPI of 90%, for example, have a KDRI (which indicates relative risk of graft failure)
    greater than 90% of recovered kidneys.
    The KDPI is simply a mapping of the KDRI from a relative risk scale to a cumulative percentage scale.
    The reference population used for this mapping is all deceased donors in the United States
    with a kidney recovered for the purpose of transplantation in the prior calendar year.
    Lower KDPI values are associated with increased donor quality and expected longevity.
