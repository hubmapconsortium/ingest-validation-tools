  description: Patient's baseline physical condition prior to immediate event leading to organ/tissue acquisition.
    For example, if a relatively healthy patient suffers trauma, and as a result of reparative surgery, a tissue sample
    is collected, the subject will be deemed “relatively healthy”.   Likewise, a relatively healthy subject may have
    experienced trauma leading to brain death.  As a result of organ donation, a sample is collected.  In this scenario,
    the subject is deemed “relatively healthy.”

  notes: Originally, not required, but everyone filled it in. This note was present - need to be filled out only if UNET data no available (e.g. live donor). Internal value, not public, optional only for donors without unet info  - TODO - We have no machinery for keeping some fields private... Should this not be included then?
