  description:  'The specific reaction pattern of erythrocytes of an individual to the antisera of one blood group; e.g., the ABO blood group consists of four major blood types: O, A, B, and AB. This classification depends on the presence or absence of two major antigens: A or B. Type O occurs when neither is present and type AB when both are present. The blood type is the genetic phenotype of the individual for one blood group system and may be determined using different antisera available for testing.'

  description: >
    The Kidney Donor Profle Index (KDPI) is a numerical measure that combines ten donor factors,
    including clinical parameters and demographics,
    to summarize into a single number the quality of deceased donor kidneys relative to other recovered kidneys.
    The KDPI is derived by frst calculating the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) for a deceased donor.
    Kidneys from a donor with a KDPI of 90%, for example, have a KDRI (which indicates relative risk of graft failure)
    greater than 90% of recovered kidneys.
    The KDPI is simply a mapping of the KDRI from a relative risk scale to a cumulative percentage scale.
    The reference population used for this mapping is all deceased donors in the United States 
    with a kidney recovered for the purpose of transplantation in the prior calendar year. 
    Lower KDPI values are associated with increased donor quality and expected longevity.
