  name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
  description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal
  detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays can generate signals
  such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
- name: acquisition_instrument_model
  description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various
  versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities.
  Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.
