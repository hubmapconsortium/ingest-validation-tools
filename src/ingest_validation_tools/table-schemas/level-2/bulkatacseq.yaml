  name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
  description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal
   detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
- name: acquisition_instrument_model
  description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities.
   Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data

- name: library_average_fragment_size
  description: Average size in bp of sequencing library fragments estimated via gel
    electrophoresis or bioanalyzer/tapestation. TODO - Unit field? Ask Nils.
- name: library_concentration_value
  description: The concentration of the library which was submitted for sequencing.
    This field is different from the "library_final_yield" because the concentration
    field takes into account how the library was pooled with other libraries. The
    "library_final_yield" should be greater than or equal to this column. - TODO - Is this correct? This is a concentration, the other is a yield, typically in ng, so they don't seem to have the same units, so an inequality makes no sense.
- name: library_concentration_unit
  description: Unit of library_concentration_value

- name: library_construction_protocols_io_doi
  description: A link to the protocol document containing the library construction
    method (including version) that was used, e.g. "Smart-Seq2", "Drop-Seq", "10X
    v3".
