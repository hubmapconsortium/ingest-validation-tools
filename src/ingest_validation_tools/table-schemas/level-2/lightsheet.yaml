  # TODO: I'm not sure number_of_z_stacks belongs:
  #   - Do you actually mean the number of layers in the stack, or are their multiple stacks?
  #   - Why is the z dimension different from the x or y? We don't want to duplicate what can be inferred from the data.

  # TODO: For consistency, can it just be "protocols_io_doi", without "acquisition_"?
  - name: protocols_io_doi
    description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay.
