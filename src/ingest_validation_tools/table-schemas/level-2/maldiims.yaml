  # include: ../includes/x_y.yaml

  -
    name: preparation_type
    description: Common methods of depositing matrix for MALDI imaging include robotic spotting, electrospray deposition, and spray-coating with an airbrush.
  -
    name: preparation_instrument_vendor
    description: The manufacturer of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the assay.
  -
    name: preparation_instrument_model
    description: The model number/name of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the assay
  -
    name: preparation_maldi_matrix
    description: The matrix is a compound of crystallized molecules that acts like a buffer between the sample and the laser. 
      It also helps ionize the sample, carrying it along the flight tube so it can be detected.
