    name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
    description: An acquisition instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. 
      Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing the molecular mass
  -
    name: acquisition_instrument_model
    description: (version) Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. 
      Differences in features of sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.
