  antibodies channel_id:
    CellDIVE dataset submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay. Antibodies metadata is provided in an antibodies.tsv file.
    There are 4 main fields in the antibodies.tsv file required for matching image files to the antibody and target protein in a given cycle/channel combination.
    The `channel_id` is represented as a cycle#/channel# combination to a given image file (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`). 
    
    The three other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
    The `antibody_name` is human readable and will be used for display in the portal.
    The `rr_id` and `uniprot_id` fields are for standardized identifiers per channel
    from [The Antibody Registry](https://antibodyregistry.org/)
    and [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) respectively.
