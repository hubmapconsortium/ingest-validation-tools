  CODEX submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV.
  For CODEX, in that TSV, the `channel_id` is a cycle#/channel# combination linked to a given image file (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`). 
  Each TIF file in a CODEX dataset contains image data captured from a single channel in a single cycle,
  identified and connected to the `channel_id` by its location in the submission directory
  (of the form `src_*/cyc*_reg*_*/*_*_Z*_CH*.tif`).

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
  For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).

    description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices (for Akoya, z-pitch=1.5um) ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments of 1.5um to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata.'
