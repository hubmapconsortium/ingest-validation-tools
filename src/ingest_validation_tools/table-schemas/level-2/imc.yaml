description_md:
  IMC submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be
  provided in an Antibodies TSV. For IMC, the `channel_id` is the name of the
  metal tag on the corresponding antibody. 
    
  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
  For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
