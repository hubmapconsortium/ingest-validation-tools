  name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
  description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection
    hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light
    of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
- name: acquisition_instrument_model
  description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions
    (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences
    in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of
    the data.
- name: preparation_instrument_vendor
  description: The manufacturer of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the
    assay.
- name: preparation_instrument_model
  description: The model number/name of the instrument used to prepare the sample
    for the assay
- name: section_prep_protocols_io_doi
  description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing tissue
    sections for the assay.
- name: reagent_prep_protocols_io_doi
  description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing reagents
    for the assay.
- name: ablation_distance_between_shots_x_value
  description: Distance (\xB5m) between laser ablation shots in the X-dimension.
- name: ablation_distance_between_shots_x_units
  description: Units of distance between laser ablation shots.
  enum: um, nm
- name: ablation_distance_between_shots_y_value
  description: Distance (\xB5m) between laser ablation shots in the Y-dimension.
- name: ablation_distance_between_shots_y_units
  description: Units of distance between laser ablation shots.
  enum: um, nm
- name: ablation_frequency_value
  description: Frequency value of laser ablation (in Hz)
- name: ablation_frequency_unit
  description: Frequency unit of laser ablation
  constraints:
    enum:
      - Hz
- name: roi_description
  description: A description of the region of interest (ROI)
- name: roi_id
  description: Identifier for the ROI
- name: acquisition_id
  description: Date and tissue type of acquisition. TODO - On our side, we strongly believe that IDs should not encode semantics. If the two pieces of information are useful, they should be recorded separately.
