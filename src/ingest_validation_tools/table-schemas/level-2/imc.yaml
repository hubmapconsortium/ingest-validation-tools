  name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
  description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection
    hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light
    of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
- name: acquisition_instrument_model
  description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions
    (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences
    in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of
    the data.
- name: preparation_instrument_vendor
  description: The manufacturer of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the
    assay.
- name: preparation_instrument_model
  description: The model number/name of the instrument used to prepare the sample
    for the assay
- name: section_prep_protocols_io_doi
  description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing tissue
    sections for the assay.
- name: reagent_prep_protocols_io_doi
  description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing reagents
    for the assay.

    The roi_id is a number from 1-n representing the ROI captured on a slide.
  type: number
- name: acquisition_id
  description: The acquisition_id refers to the directory containing the ROI images for a slide. Together, the acquisition_id and the roi_id
    indicate the slide-ROI represented in the image.
