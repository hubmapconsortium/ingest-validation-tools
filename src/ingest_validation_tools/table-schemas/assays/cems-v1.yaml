      - DDA
      - DIA
- name: ms_scan_mode
  description: Indicates whether the data were generated using MS, MS/MS or MS3.

      - MS
      - MS/MS

- name: ce_interface
  description: Method by which the separation capillary interfaces with mass spectrometer and enables electrospray ionization while completing the separation circuit. The two most prevalent commercial interfaces are sheathless and sheath-flow.
  constraints:
    enum:
      - sheath-flow
      - sheathless
- name: ce_capillary_coating
  description: Treatment of surface of separation capillary. Capillary coating affects the absorption of analytes on capillary inner walls and regulates electroosmotic flow. Entries should indicate the charge of the coating and chemical composition (e.g. "Neutral; Polyacrylamide" or "Positive; Polyethyleneimine" or "Uncoated").
- name: ce_background_electrolyte
  description: Chemical composition of the background electrolyte that fills the separation capillary (e.g. "3% acetic acid").
- name: ce_instrument_vendor
  description: The manufacturer of the instrument used for capillary zone electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis is used to separate complex biological mixtures prior to performing MS-based analyses. Separations are performed based the analytes migrate through an electrolyte solution in the presence of an electric field.
- name: ce_instrument_model
  description: The model name of the instrument used for capillary zone electrophoresis.
- name: ce_electroosmotic_flow
  description: Properties of the electroosmotic flow (EOF). Normal EOF is defined as flow towards the cathode, reversed EOF is defined as flow towards the anode, and suppressed EOF involves marginal to almost no flow (e.g. when a neutral coating is used).
  constraints:
    enum:
      - suppressed
      - normal
      - reversed
- name: spatial_type
  description: Specifies whether or not the analysis was performed in a spatialy targeted manner and the technique used for spatial sampling. For example, Laser-capture microdissection (LCM), Liquid Extraction Surface Analysis (LESA), Nanodroplet Processing in One pot for Trace Samples (nanoPOTS).
  constraints:
    required: False
    enum:
      - LCM
      - LESA
      - nanoPOTS
      - microLESA
- name: spatial_sampling_type
  description: Specifies whether or not the analysis was performed in a spatially targeted manner. Spatial profiling experiments target specific tissue foci but do not necessarily generate images. Spatial imaging expriments collect data from a regular array (pixels) that can be visualized as heat maps of ion intensity at each location (molecular images). Leave blank if data are derived from bulk analysis.
  constraints:
    required: False
    enum:
      - profiling
      - imaging
