    name: resolution_z_value
    description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices (for Akoya, z-pitch=1.5um) ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments of 1.5um to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata.'

  -
    name: number_of_barcode_regions_per_barcode_probe
    description: Number of barcode regions on each mRNA barcode probe (the paper describes mRNA probes with 4 barcoded regions)
  -
    name: number_of_readout_probes_per_channel
    description: Number of readout probes that can be interrogated per channel per cycle (the paper describes 20 readout probes per channel (x 3 channels -> total = 60))

    name: number_of_pseudocolors_per_channel
    description: Number of pseudocolors that can be assigned to each fluorescent channel (the paper describes 20 pseudocolors per channel (x 3 channels -> total = 60)
  -
    name: number_of_channels
    description: Number of fluorescent channels (the paper describes 3 channels - for 3 fluorescent dyes)
  -
    name: number_of_cycles
    description: For each barcode region being interrogated, the number of cycles of 1. Hybridization of readout probes, 2. imaging, 3. Washes (the paper describes 1 readout probe per hyb cycle -> 20 readout probes = 20 hyb cycles)
