  Lightsheet uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay
  to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the `channel_id` is the
  name of the fluorophore tag on the antibody.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
  For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
