- name: library_construction_protocols_io_doi
  description: A link to the protocol document containing the library construction method (including version) that was used, e.g. "Smart-Seq2", "Drop-Seq", "10X v3". DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for this assay.

  constraints:
    required: False
  description: Which read file(s) contains the cell barcode. Multiple cell_barcode_read files must be provided as a comma-delimited list (e.g. file1,file2,file3). This field is not required for barcoding by single-cell combinatorial indexing.

  description: Length of the cell barcode in base pairs. Cell barcodes are, for example, 3 x 8 bp sequences that are spaced by constant sequences, the offsets. (Does not apply to sciATACseq, SNARE-seq and BulkATAC.)
