description_md: 
  This schema is for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). v2 adds `mass_resolving_power`, `mz_resolving_power`, `ion_mobility`,
  `spatial_type`, `spatial_sampling_type`, `spatial_target`, and `resolution_{x/y}_{value/unit}`. In the case of datasets in which more
  than one `analyte_type` was interrogated (e.g. lipids plus metabolytes), those datasets should be split into one dataset per analyte.
  For an example of an LC-MS dataset & directory, see this [example LC-MS dataset](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/browse/dataset/7f1fd7b9c8c3745fcab037a2fa37f5b9)

    Bottom-up refers to analyzing proteins in a sample by digesting them to peptides.
    Top-down refers to analyzing whole proteins without digestion. LC-MS and MS are for lipids/metabolites.
    LC-MS Bottom-Up and MS Bottom-Up are for peptides. LC-MS Top-Down and MS Top-Down are for proteins.
