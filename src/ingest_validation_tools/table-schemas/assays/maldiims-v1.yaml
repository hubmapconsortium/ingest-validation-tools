- name: preparation_type
  description: Common methods of depositing matrix for MALDI imaging include robotic spotting, electrospray deposition, and spray-coating with an airbrush.
# include: ../includes/v0/prep_instrument.yaml
- name: preparation_maldi_matrix
  description: The matrix is a compound of crystallized molecules that acts like a buffer between the sample and the laser.
    It also helps ionize the sample, carrying it along the flight tube so it can be detected.
