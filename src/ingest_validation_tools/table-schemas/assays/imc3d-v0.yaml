  3D IMC uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be
  provided in an Antibodies TSV. For 3D IMC, the `channel_id` is the name of the
  metal tag on the corresponding antibody.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
  For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
