  CODEX uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV.
  For CODEX, in that TSV, the `channel_id` is a cycle#/channel# combination linked to a given image file (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`).
  Each TIF file in a CODEX dataset contains image data captured from a single channel in a single cycle,
  identified and connected to the `channel_id` by its location in the upload directory
  (of the form `src_*/cyc*_reg*_*/*_*_Z*_CH*.tif`).

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
  For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).

  description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
  constraints:
    enum: ['Keyence','Zeiss']
- name: acquisition_instrument_model
  description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.

- name: resolution_z_value
  description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices (for Akoya, z-pitch=1.5um) ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments of 1.5um to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata.'
