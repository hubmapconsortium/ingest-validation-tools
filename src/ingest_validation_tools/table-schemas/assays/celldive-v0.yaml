  CellDIVE submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay
  to be provided in an Antibodies TSV.
  For CellDIVE, the `channel_id` is represented as a cycle#/channel# combination
  (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`) linked to a given image file in the directory. 
    
  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
  For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
