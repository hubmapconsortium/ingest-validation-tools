    name: resolution_z_value
    description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata. Leave blank if not applicable.'
