- name: resolution_z_value
  description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices, ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments to capture images of several focal planes.'

- name: number_of_channels
  description: Number of channels capturing the emission spectrum from natural fluorophores in the sample.
- name: overall_protocols_io_doi
  description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the overall protocol for the assay.
