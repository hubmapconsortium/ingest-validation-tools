- name: spatial_sampling_type
  description: Specifies whether or not the analysis was performed in a spatially targeted manner. Spatial profiling experiments target specific tissue foci but do not necessarily generate images. Spatial imaging expriments collect data from a regular array (pixels) that can be visualized as heat maps of ion intensity at each location (molecular images). Leave blank if data are derived from bulk analysis.
