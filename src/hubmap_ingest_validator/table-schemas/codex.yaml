    heading: Level 2
    name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
    description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
    constraints:
      enum: ['Keyence','Zeiss']
  -
    name: acquisition_instrument_model
    description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.
    constraints:
      enum: ['BZ-X800','BZ-X710','Axio Observer Z1']
  -
    name: resolution_x_value
    description: The width of a pixel. (Akoya pixel is 377nm square)
    type: number
  -
    name: resolution_x_unit
    description: The unit of measurement of width of a pixel.(nm)
    constraints:
      enum: ['mm', 'um', 'nm']
  -
    name: resolution_y_value
    description: The height of a pixel. (Akoya pixel is 377nm square)
    type: number
  -
    name: resolution_y_unit
    description: The unit of measurement of height of a pixel. (nm)
    constraints:
      enum: ['mm', 'um', 'nm']
  -
    name: resolution_z_value
    description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices (for Akoya, z-pitch=1.5um) ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments of 1.5um to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata.'
    type: number
    constraints:
      required: False
