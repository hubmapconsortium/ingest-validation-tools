    heading: Level 2
    name: acquisition_instrument_vendor
    description: An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.
  -
    name: acquisition_instrument_model
    description: Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.
  -
    name: resolution_x_value
    description: The width of a pixel. (seqFISH pixel is about 0.110µm square)
  -
    name: resolution_x_unit
    description: The unit of measurement of width of a pixel.(µm)
  -
    name: resolution_y_value
    description: The height of a pixel. (seqFISH pixel is about 0.110µm square)
  -
    name: resolution_y_unit
    description: The unit of measurement of height of a pixel. (µm)
  -
    name: resolution_z_value
    description: 'Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices (for Akoya, z-pitch=1.5um) ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments of 1.5um to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata.'
    constraints:
      required: False
  -
    name: resolution_z_unit
    description: The unit of incremental distance between image slices.(um)
  -
    name: preparation_instrument_vendor
    description: The manufacturer of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the assay.
  -
    name: preparation_instrument_model
    description: The model number/name of the instrument used to prepare the sample for the assay
  -
    name: number_of_barcode_probes
    description: Number of barcode probes targeting mRNAs (eg. 24,000 barcode probes = 24,000 mRNAs - 1 per mRNA of interest)
  -
    name: number_of_barcode_regions_per_barcode_probe
    description: Number of barcode regions on each mRNA barcode probe (the paper describes mRNA probes with 4 barcoded regions)
  -
    name: number_of_readout_probes_per_channel
    description: Number of readout probes that can be interrogated per channel per cycle (the paper describes 20 readout probes per channel (x 3 channels -> total = 60))
  -
    name: number_of_pseudocolors_per_channel
    description: Number of pseudocolors that can be assigned to each fluorescent channel (the paper describes 20 pseudocolors per channel (x 3 channels -> total = 60)
  -
    name: number_of_channels
    description: Number of fluorescent channels (the paper describes 3 channels - for 3 fluorescent dyes)
  -
    name: number_of_cycles
    description: For each barcode region being interrogated, the number of cycles of 1. Hybridization of readout probes, 2. imaging, 3. Washes (the paper describes 1 readout probe per hyb cycle -> 20 readout probes = 20 hyb cycles)
  -
    name: section_prep_protocols_io_doi
    description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing tissue sections for the assay.
  -
    name: reagent_prep_protocols_io_doi
    description: DOI for protocols.io referring to the protocol for preparing reagents for the assay.
