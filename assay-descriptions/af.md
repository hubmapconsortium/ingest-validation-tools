# Autofluorescence Microscopy

Autofluorescence microscopy exploits endogenous fluorescence in a biological tissue to capture an image. The image can then be used to integrate other images from multiple modalities and to align tissues within a 3D experiment. Autofluorescence microscopy requires no sample preparation and can be performed on any fluorescence microscope.
