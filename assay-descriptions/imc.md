# Image Mass Cytometry (IMC)

Imaging Mass Cytometry combines standard immunohistochemistry with CyTOF mass cytometry to resolve the cellular localization of up to 40 proteins in a tissue sample.  Multiplexing of dozens of proteins is possible because the antibodies are tagged with rare-earth metal isotopes of defined atomic mass rather than fluorophores, which are subject to spectral signal overlap. High-resolution laser ablation of tissue stained with these antibody-metal conjugates generates clouds of tissue particles which are atomized, ionized, and detected in a time-of-flight mass cytometer. Signals are then plotted against the coordinates of each single laser shot to synthesize one image per mass channel with high-dimensional images produced by overlaying images from multiple channels.
