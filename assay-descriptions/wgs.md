# Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)    
Whole genome sequencing (_WGS_) measures the genome-wide nucleotide sequence in a biological sample. Generally, the purpose is to screen the entire genome for all sequence variations (_against a reference sequence_) such as benign sequence variants (_SNPs_) or candidate pathogenic mutations. Examples of sequence variants include chromosomal rearrangements, nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions. An example use case would be a genome-wide search for somatic mutations (_cancer-causing mutations that arose in a somatic cell, as opposed to arising in a germline cell_) by comparing DNA sequence in a patient’s tumor cells to that in the same patient’s healthy cells.
