# Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-IMS)    

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (_MALDI_) imaging mass spectrometry (_IMS_) combines the sensitivity and molecular specificity of MS with the spatial fidelity of classical microscopy. IMS is routinely used to study a variety of analyte classes including pharmaceuticals, metabolites, lipids, nucleic acids, glycans, peptides and proteins. Briefly, tissue samples are thinly sectioned, mounted onto conductive glass slides, and coated with a light absorbing matrix that facilitates desorption and ionization of endogenous molecules. Ions are generated by laser irradiation at each position (_pixel coordinate_) within a region of interest in the tissue resulting in the generation of a mass/charge (_m/z_) signal spectrum for each pixel.  The spatial resolution is defined by the size of the laser spot at the sample surface, the spacing between pixel coordinates in the array (_i.e. pitch_), and by the sample preparation processes. An image is then synthesized by plotting the m/z signal intensities for the entire array of pixel coordinates.
