# RNA Sequencing (RNAseq)    

While bulk RNAseq elucidates the average gene expression profile in cells comprising a tissue sample, single-cell RNAseq employs per-cell and per-molecule barcoding to enable single-cell resolution of the gene expression profile. The RNAseq assay itself is the same for bulk and single-cell templates. Evaluation of the total gene expression profile of a biological sample is referred to as “transcriptomics”. Genes are transcribed in response to some signal(s) to generate certain gene products (proteins) required by the cell. Transcribed RNA then undergoes processing (_addition of a poly-A tail, 5’-capping, exon splicing_) to generate messenger RNA (_mRNA_), which is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation into the corresponding encoded protein. The derived sequences of each mRNA transcript are aligned against a reference genome to establish the identity of the corresponding gene. Since each mRNA molecule represents a single gene transcript, the total mRNA-count aligning to a gene represents the expression profile for that gene.
