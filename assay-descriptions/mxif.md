# Multiplexed Immunofluorescence (MxIF)    

MxIF is used to visualize the distribution of multiple protein antigens in an intact tissue section by labeling them with fluorophore-tagged antibodies. Tagged antibodies are iteratively incubated with a tissue section, visualized with a fluorescence microscope and then stripped.
