# Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)

Coupling of liquid chromatography (LC) to mass spectrometry (MS) has become an indispensable technique for analyzing complex mixtures of biomolecules. Chromatography is a technique for separation of molecules based on their interactions with a stationary phase and a mobile phase of flowing solvent. For example, in reversed-phase chromatography, the stationary phase is commonly composed of hydrophobic C18-functionalized silica particles that are packed into a column while the mobile phase is composed of a hydrophilic solution. Based on differences in hydrophobicity, biomolecules partition differently between the stationary and mobile phases. Consequently, biomolecules elute off of a column at different times. Mass spectrometry measures the molecular weights of eluted biomolecules via detection of gas-phase ions. To obtain the masses of eluted biomolecules via mass spectrometry, solution-phase biomolecules are most commonly converted to gas-phase ions via electrospray ionization in which a high voltage is applied to the liquid coming out of the column.
