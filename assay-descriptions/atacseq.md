# Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATACseq)    

While bulk ATACseq (_Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin_) resolves the _average_ of chromatin architecture in cells comprising a tissue sample, single-cell ATACseq employs per-cell and per-molecule barcoding to enable single-cell resolution of chromatin architecture. The ATACseq assay itself is the same for bulk and single-cell templates. ATAC-seq employs a genetically engineered Tn5 transposase that inserts sequencing adapters into accessible regions on the chromatin surface. Analysis of the sequences derived from the Tn5 sequencing adapters allows identification of those regions of the chromatin located on the cell-state-specific surface of the chromatin.
