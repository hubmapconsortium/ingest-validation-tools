# Co-detection by indexing (CODEX)

Codex is a strategy for conducting highly multiplexed microscopy of fluorescent-dye-labeled antigens. In brief, antibodies to antigens of interest are barcoded with unique oligonucleotide sequences. A complementary oligonucleotide sequence tagged with a fluorescent probe hybridizes to each antibody barcode allowing visualization of the targeted antigen. The fluorophores are then stripped from the tissue and the process is repeated allowing up to 50 protein targets to be visualized within a single tissue section.
