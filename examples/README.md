# `examples/`

This directory contains example inputs and outputs of different components of this system.
Adding more examples is one way to test new schemas or new code...
but it's possible to have too much of a good thing:
If we eventually _do_ need to change the behavior,
sorting out redundant failing tests can be a nuisance.
Particularly when testing new code, granular unit tests can give you more information than coarse end-to-end tests.

Putting that aside, here is what we have:

## `cleanup-examples/`

Expected output from `cleanup_whitespace.py`: Example input is generated by script, and is git-ignored.

## `custom-constraint-examples/`

We've added a number of extensions to the base TSV validation we get from
[Frictionless Table Schemas](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/).
Each subdirectory contains a `schema.yaml` that exercises one extension,
an `input.tsv` to validate, and an `output.txt` with the error message produced.

## `dataset-examples/`

The core of `ingest-validation-tools` is Dataset upload validation.
Each subdirectory here is an end-to-end test of upload validation: Each contains
- a `upload` directory, containing one or more metadata TSVs, dataset directories, and contributors and antibodies TSVs,
- and a `README.md` with the output when validating that directory.

Examples which are expected to produce errors are prefixed with `bad-`, those that are good, `good-`.

In `test-dataset-examples.sh`, validation is run with several commandline options which may differ
from those used by end-users. This exercises less common options,
minimizes dependence on network resources during tests (`--offline`) and formats the output (`--output as_md`)

To add a new test, create a new subdirectory with a `good-` or `bad-` name, add your `upload` subdirectory,
and an empty `README.md`. Then run `tests/test-dataset-examples.sh`: It will fail on your example,
and give you a command to run that will fix your example. Run this command, _but make sure the result makes sense!_
The software can tell you what the result of validation is, but it can't know whether that result is actually correct.

## `dataset-iec-examples/`

After upload, TSVs are split up, and directory structures are re-arranged.
These structures can still be validated, but it takes a slightly different set of options,
and those options are tested here. 

## `sample-examples/`

Distinct from `validate_upload.py`, `validate_samples.py` validates Sample TSVs.
These are much simpler than Dataset uploads, so we only need a single good and bad example.
