- Does this change have buy-in from other groups providing the same kind of data?
- Can you quote or reference any outside documentation that motivates this change?
- Is this change backward compatible, or does it make validation more stringent?

@icaoberg will evaluate this request, and if it can move forward,
will file a PR for @pdblood to review,
and @mccalluc will make sure tests pass before merging.
