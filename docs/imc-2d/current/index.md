| pattern | required? | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>extras\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Folder for general lab-specific files related to the dataset. [Exists in all assays] |
| <code>extras\/.hardware\.json$</code> | ‚úì | JSON file containing the machine parameters/settings. This is akin to the microscope_environment.json file that's used to describe the imaging equipment. |
| <code>raw\/.*</code> | ‚úì | This is a directory containing raw data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Raw image files. Using this subdirectory allows for harmonization with other more complex assays, like Visium that includes both raw imaging and sequencing data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.mcd$</code> | ‚úì | Proprietary data file format generated by the Fluidigm (Standard Biotools) Hyperion series instruments to store imaging mass cytometry data.  This file contains xyzc pixel intensity values, pre- and post-ablation panoramas, and acquisition metadata. Tools to read are <https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/readimc> and MCDViewer <https://www.standardbio.com/products/software#hyperion-anchor>. No public schema is available. |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.tiff$</code> | ‚úì | Raw image file. |
| <code>raw\/images\/tiles\.csv$</code> | ‚úì | This file contains the approximate coordinates for each of the tiled raw images. |
| <code>lab_processed\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/.*</code> | ‚úì | This is a directory containing processed image files |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff$</code> | ‚úì | OME-TIFF file (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0> |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]*ome-tiff\.channels\.csv$</code> | ‚úì | This file provides essential documentation pertaining to each channel of the accommpanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel. The required fields are detailed <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEJSb0xn5C5fB3k62pj1CyHNybpt4-YtvUs5SUMS44o/edit#gid=0> |
