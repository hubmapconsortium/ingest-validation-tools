## Donor

### `donor_source_institution`

| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| enum | `living` or `deceased` |

### `donor_health_status`
Patient's physical condition immediately preceding death. TODO - Confirm that you want precisely these three mutually exclusive values? I thought HuBMAP included only healthy tissue?

## Biospecimen

### `biospecimen_aliquot_mechanism_of_stabilization`

### `biospecimen_aliquot_long_term_preservative_type`
The final medium in which sample is placed. TODO - Are these the precise values you want? Do you also want to reference a protocol? Does "none" mean there is no long-term preservation? or that it's unknown? FFPE moved here as Sanjay requested. Confirm that this is correct?
