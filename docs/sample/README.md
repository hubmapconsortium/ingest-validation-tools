| pattern (regular expression) | required? | description |
| --- | --- | --- |

## IDs

### `sample_id`
(No description for this field was supplied.)

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| pattern (regular expression) | `([A-Z]+[0-9]+)-(BL\|BR\|LB\|RB\|HT\|LK\|RK\|LI\|LV\|LL\|RL\|LY\d\d\|SI\|SP\|TH\|TR\|UR\|OT)(-\d+)+(_\d+)?` |

## Donor

### `vital_state`
Identify the vital state of the donor.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| enum | `living` or `deceased` |

### `health_status`
Patient's baseline physical condition prior to immediate event leading to organ/tissue acquisition. For example, if a relatively healthy patient suffers trauma, and as a result of reparative surgery, a tissue sample is collected, the subject will be deemed ‚Äúrelatively healthy‚Äù.   Likewise, a relatively healthy subject may have experienced trauma leading to brain death.  As a result of organ donation, a sample is collected.  In this scenario, the subject is deemed ‚Äúrelatively healthy.‚Äù.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| enum | `cancer`, `relatively healthy`, or `chronic illness` |
