### IDs

##### `sample_id`
(No description for this field was supplied.)
| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| pattern (regular expression) | `([A-Z]+[0-9]+)-[A-Z]{2}\d*(-\d+)+(_\d+)?` |

### Donor

##### `vital_state`
Identify the vital state of the donor.
| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| enum | `living` or `deceased` |

##### `health_status`
Patient's baseline physical condition prior to immediate event leading to organ/tissue acquisition. For example, if a relatively healthy patient suffers trauma, and as a result of reparative surgery, a tissue sample is collected, the subject will be deemed ‚Äúrelatively healthy‚Äù.   Likewise, a relatively healthy subject may have experienced trauma leading to brain death.  As a result of organ donation, a sample is collected.  In this scenario, the subject is deemed ‚Äúrelatively healthy.‚Äù.
| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |
| enum | `cancer`, `relatively healthy`, or `chronic illness` |

Type of solution that was used to perfuse the organ.

##### `pathologist_report`
Further details on organ level QC checks.
