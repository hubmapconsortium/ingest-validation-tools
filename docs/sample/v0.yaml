  notes: Originally, not required, but everyone filled it in. This note was present
    - need to be filled out only if UNET data no available (e.g. live donor). Internal
    value, not public, optional only for donors without unet info  - TODO - We have
    no machinery for keeping some fields private... Should this not be included then?
