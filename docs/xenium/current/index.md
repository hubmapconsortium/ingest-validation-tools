If an overlay is used, then the overlay details will be provided in the protocols.io protocol. If used, this needs to be uploaded. It is not included in the OME TIFF. This can be a JPEG or TIFF file |
| <code>lab_processed\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Processed image files |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff</code> (example: <code>lab_processed/images/HBM892.MDXS.293.ome.tiff</code>) | ‚úì | OME-TIFF files (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the microscopy experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. For Visium this stitched file should only include the single capture area relevant to the current dataset. For GeoMx there will be one OME TIFF file per slide, with each slide including multiple AOIs. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0> |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]*ome-tiff\.channels\.csv</code> | ‚úì | This file provides essential documentation pertaining to each channel of the accommpanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel. The required fields are detailed <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEJSb0xn5C5fB3k62pj1CyHNybpt4-YtvUs5SUMS44o/edit#gid=0> |
