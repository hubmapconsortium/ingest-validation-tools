description_md: 'This schema is for imaging mass cytometry (IMC). IMC uploads require
  metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV.
  For IMC, the `channel_id` is the name of the metal tag on the corresponding antibody.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more
  information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).'
