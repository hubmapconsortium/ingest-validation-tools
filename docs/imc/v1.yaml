description_md: 'IMC uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay
  to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For IMC, the `channel_id` is the name of the
  metal tag on the corresponding antibody.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more
  information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).'
