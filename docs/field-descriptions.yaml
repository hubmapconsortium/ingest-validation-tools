  Risk Index (KDRI) for a deceased donor. Kidneys from a donor with a KDPI of 90%,
  for example, have a KDRI (which indicates relative risk of graft failure) greater
  than 90% of recovered kidneys. The KDPI is simply a mapping of the KDRI from a relative
  risk scale to a cumulative percentage scale. The reference population used for this
  mapping is all deceased donors in the United States  with a kidney recovered for
  the purpose of transplantation in the prior calendar year.  Lower KDPI values are
  associated with increased donor quality and expected longevity. https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1512/guide_to_calculating_interpreting_kdpi.pdf
