| pattern | required? | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>extras\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Folder for general lab-specific files related to the dataset. |
| <code>derived\/.*</code> | ‚úì | The EPIC data is placed in TOP/derived/, so it doesn't conflict with any files, if it's uploaded with a primary dataset. |
| <code>derived\/extras\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Folder for general lab-specific files related to the derived dataset. |
| <code>derived\/obj_by_analyte\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Directory containing object by analyte table(s). |
| <code>derived\/obj_by_analyte\/[^\/]+\.h5mu$</code> | ‚úì | This is a MuData object conforming to the HuBMAP object x analyte file specifications and not a more general hdf5 hierarchical data file. There should be one file containing all relevant AnnData objects. |
| <code>derived\/obj_by_analyte\/README\.md$</code> |  | A file containing clear explanations of all data included within thsi dataset submission that will allow anyone who is interested in reusing your data to easily understand it. In the interest of standardization and comprehensiveness, we recommend consulting the [Dryad guidelines and resources](https://blog.datadryad.org/2023/10/18/for-authors-creating-a-readme-for-rapid-data-publication/) and [Dryad example README file](https://datadryad.org/docs/README.md). |
| <code>derived\/obj_by_analyte\/pipeline_extras\/.*</code> |  | Additional parameter, QA/QC, log or analyses files generated by the analysis pipeline. This might, for example, include the "_cmdline", "metrics_summary.csv", and "web_summary.html" files from a 10X Genomics pipeline. |
