Prepare your metadata based on the latest metadata schema using one of the template files below. See the instructions in the [Metadata Validation Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfgiDGbyO4K4Hz1FMsJjmJd9RdwjShtJqFYNwKpbcZY) document for more information on preparing and validating your metadata.tsv file prior to submission.

[This link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0) lists the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. We require both the the raw image file as well as a lab-created image based on the raw one in the open source OME-TIFF format. Our processing pipeline uses the OME-TIFF image to generate an [OME-TIFF pyramid](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.0.0/ome-tiff/specification.html) for portal visualization. We recommend [BioFormats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/) for converting raw image files to OME-TIFF. A relevant guide for converting raw TIFF image files to OME-TIFF using BioFormats can be found [here](https://docs.facebase.org/docs/convert-tif/).
