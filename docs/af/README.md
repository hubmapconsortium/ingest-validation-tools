Email address for the principal investigator.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| format | `email` |
| required | `True` |

### `assay_category`
Each assay is placed into one of the following 3 general categories: generation of images of microscopic entities, identification & quantitation of molecules by mass spectrometry, and determination of nucleotide sequence.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| enum | `imaging` |
| required | `True` |

### `assay_type`
The specific type of assay being executed.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| enum | `AF` |
| required | `True` |

### `analyte_class`
Analytes are the target molecules being measured with the assay. Leave blank if not applicable.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `boolean` |
| required | `True` |

An acquisition_instrument is the device that contains the signal detection hardware and signal processing software. Assays generate signals such as light of various intensities or color or signals representing molecular mass.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |

### `acquisition_instrument_model`
Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |

### `resolution_x_value`
The width of a pixel.
