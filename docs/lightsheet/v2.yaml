description_md: 'Lightsheet uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the
  assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the `channel_id` is the
  name of the fluorophore tag on the antibody.

  Version 2 has 5 new fields for metadata describing the Z-dimension specifically
  relevant to lightsheet. These values provide the total number of image sections
  captured, the incremental value and unit of distance between the sections and the
  value and unit of the total distance captured.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more
  information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).'
