Lightsheet submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay
to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the `channel_id` is the
name of the fluorophore tag on the antibody. 
  
The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies.
For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
