- [üìù Excel template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/master/docs/lightsheet/lightsheet-metadata.xlsx): For metadata entry.
- [üìù TSV template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/master/docs/lightsheet/lightsheet-metadata.tsv): Alternative for metadata entry.

Lightsheet uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the `channel_id` is the name of the fluorophore tag on the antibody.
The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
