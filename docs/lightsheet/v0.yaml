description_md: "Lightsheet submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in\
  \ the assay\nto be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the `channel_id`\
  \ is the\nname of the fluorophore tag on the antibody. \n  \nThe other fields function\
  \ the same way for all assays using antibodies.\nFor more information, see the [Antibodies\
  \ TSV documentation](../antibodies).\n"
