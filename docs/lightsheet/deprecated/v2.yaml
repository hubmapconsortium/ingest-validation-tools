description_md: "Lightsheet uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the\
  \ assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For Lightsheet, the `channel_id` is\
  \ the name of the fluorophore tag on the antibody. For an example of a lightsheet\
  \ dataset & directory, see this  [example lightsheet dataset](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/browse/dataset/b6eba6afe660a8a85c2648e368b0cf9f#files)\
  \  and click the Globus link. \nVersion 2 has 5 new fields for metadata describing\
  \ the Z-dimension specifically relevant to lightsheet. These values provide the\
  \ total number of image sections captured, the incremental value and unit of distance\
  \ between the sections and the value and unit of the total distance captured.\n\
  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more\
  \ information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies)."
