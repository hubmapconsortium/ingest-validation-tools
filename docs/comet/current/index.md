| pattern | required? | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>extras\/.*</code> | ✓ | Folder for general lab-specific files related to the dataset. [Exists in all assays] |
| <code>extras\/microscope_hardware\.json$</code> | ✓ | **[QA/QC]** A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the hardware components of the microscope. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document. |
| <code>extras\/microscope_settings\.json$</code> |  | **[QA/QC]** A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the settings that were used to acquire the image data. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document. |
| <code>raw\/.*</code> | ✓ | This is a directory containing raw data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/.*</code> | ✓ | Raw image files. Using this subdirectory allows for harmonization with other more complex assays, like Visium that includes both raw imaging and sequencing data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/.*</code> | ✓ | Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/.*</code> | ✓ | This is a directory containing processed image files |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff$</code> | ✓ | OME-TIFF file (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0> |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]*ome-tiff\.channels\.csv$</code> | ✓ | This file provides essential documentation pertaining to each channel of the accompanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel. The required fields are detailed here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEJSb0xn5C5fB3k62pj1CyHNybpt4-YtvUs5SUMS44o/edit#gid=0> |
