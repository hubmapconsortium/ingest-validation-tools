### `channel_id`
The cycle/channel in which the protein was assessed with this antibody. For example, an experiment that involves 3 hybridization cycles & 4 signal detection channels would have **channel_id**s numbered 1-12. Antibodies detected with channel 1 would have **channel_id** 1,5 & 9. Antibodies detected with channel 2 would have **channel_id** 2,6 & 10 and so on for the remaining antibodies.

| type | `integer` |

### `antibody_name`
Anti-(target name) antibody. Not validated or used down-stream.



### `rr_id`
The rr_id is a unique antibody identifier that comes from the Antibody Registry (https://antibodyregistry.org). Example: `AB_10002075`.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| pattern (regular expression) | `AB_\d+` |

### `uniprot_accession_number`
The uniprot_accession_number is a unique identifier for proteins in the UniProt database (https://www.uniprot.org). Example: `P0DTC1`.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| pattern (regular expression) | `P[0-9A-Z]+` |

### `lot_number`
The lot# is specific to the vendor. (eg: Abcam lot# GR3238979-1)



### `dilution`
Antibody solutions may be diluted according to the experimental protocol. Example: `1/200`.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| pattern (regular expression) | `1/\d+` |

### `conjugated_cat_number`
An antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent tag or a metal tag for detection. Conjugated antibodies may be purchased from commercial providers.



### `conjugated_tag`
The name of the entity conjugated to the antibody.
