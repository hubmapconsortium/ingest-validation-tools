The file should minimally include:target gene id, probe seq, probe id. The contents of this file are modeled after the 10x Genomics probe set file (see <https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/probe-sets/probe-set-file-descriptions/probe-set-file-descriptions#probe_set_csv_file>). |
| <code>raw\/micron_to_mosaic_pixel_transform\.csv</code> |  | Matrix used to transform from pixels to physical distance. |
| <code>raw\/manifest\.json</code> | ✓ | This file contains stain by channel details and pixel details. |
| <code>raw\/codebook\.csv</code> | ✓ | CSV containing codebook information for the experiment. Rows are barcodes and columns are imaging rounds. The first column is the barcode target, and the following column IDs are expected to be sequential, and round identifiers are expected to be integers (not roman numerals). |
| <code>raw\/positions\.csv</code> | ✓ | File that includes the top left coordinate of each tiled image. This is required to stitch the images. |
| <code>raw\/dataorganization\.csv</code> | ✓ | Necessary image definitions |
| <code>raw\/[^\/]+\.DAX</code> | ✓ | The raw image stack. |
| <code>raw\/images\/.*</code> | ✓ | Directory containing raw image files. This directory should include at least one raw file. |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.tif</code> | ✓ | Raw microscope file for the experiment. |
| <code>lab_processed\/.*</code> | ✓ | Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/detected_transcripts\.csv</code> | ✓ | A file containing the locations of each RNA target. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/.*</code> | ✓ | Processed image files |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff</code> (example: <code>lab_processed/images/HBM892.MDXS.293.ome.tiff</code>) | ✓ | OME-TIFF files (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the microscopy experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. For Visium this stitched file should only include the single capture area relevant to the current dataset. For GeoMx there will be one OME TIFF file per slide, with each slide including multiple AOIs. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0> |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]*ome-tiff\.channels\.csv</code> | ✓ | This file provides essential documentation pertaining to each channel of the accommpanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel. The required fields are detailed <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEJSb0xn5C5fB3k62pj1CyHNybpt4-YtvUs5SUMS44o/edit#gid=0> |
