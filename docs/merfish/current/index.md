| <code>raw\/.*</code> | ‚úì | All raw data files for the experiment. |
| <code>raw\/additional_panels_used\.csv</code> |  | If multiple commercial probe panels were used, then the primary probe panel should be selected in the "oligo_probe_panel" metadata field. The additional panels must be included in this file. Each panel record should include:manufacturer, model/name, product code. |
| <code>raw\/gene_panel\.csv</code> | ‚úì | The list of target genes. The expected format is gene_id (ensembl ID), gene_name. |
| <code>raw\/custom_probe_set\.csv</code> |  | This file should contain any custom probes used and must be included if the metadata field "is_custom_probes_used" is "Yes". The file should minimally include:target gene id, probe seq, probe id. The contents of this file are modeled after the 10x Genomics probe set file (see <https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/probe-sets/probe-set-file-descriptions/probe-set-file-descriptions#probe_set_csv_file>). |

| <code>raw\/manifest\.json</code> | ‚úì | This file contains stain by channel details and pixel details. |
| <code>raw\/codebook\.csv</code> | ‚úì | CSV containing codebook information for the experiment. Rows are barcodes and columns are imaging rounds. The first column is the barcode target, and the following column IDs are expected to be sequential, and round identifiers are expected to be integers (not roman numerals). |

If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. For Visium this stitched file should only include the single capture area relevant to the current dataset. For GeoMx there will be one OME TIFF file per slide, with each slide including multiple AOIs. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0> |
