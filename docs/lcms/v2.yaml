description_md: This schema is for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS).
  v2 adds `mass_resolving_power`, `mz_resolving_power`, `ion_mobility`, `spatial_type`,
  `spatial_sampling_type`, `spatial_target`, and `resolution_{x/y}_{value/unit}`.
  In the case of datasets in which more than one `analyte_type` was interrogated (e.g.
  lipids plus metabolytes), those datasets should be split into one dataset per analyte.
  For an example of an LC-MS dataset & directory, see this [example LC-MS dataset](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/browse/dataset/7f1fd7b9c8c3745fcab037a2fa37f5b9)
