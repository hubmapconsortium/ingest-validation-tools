| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>extras\/.*</code> | ✓ | Folder for general lab-specific files related to the dataset. [Exists in all assays] |
| <code>extras\/microscope_hardware\.json</code> | ✓ | **[QA/QC]** A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the hardware components of the microscope. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document. |
| <code>extras\/microscope_settings\.json</code> |  | **[QA/QC]** A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the settings that were used to acquire the image data. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document. |
| <code>raw\/.*</code> | ✓ | This is a directory containing raw data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/.*</code> | ✓ | Raw image files. Using this subdirectory allows for harmonization with other more complex assays, like Visium that includes both raw imaging and sequencing data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.xpd</code> | ✓ | Experimental set up of the Phenocycler-Fusion run. File includes cycle information, antibodies utilized, and the experimental design of the run |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.qptiff</code> | ✓ | Final image file produced by the Phenocycler-Fusion |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/.*</code> | ✓ | These are the files from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. The dataset should include all files from this directory except the "qptiff.intermediate" files. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/[^\/]+\.qptiff\.raw</code> | ✓ | Raw image files from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/[^\/]+\.qptiff\.intermediate</code> |  | Intermediate image files from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. These files are not required. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/(?:CombineInputs.txt&#124;FocusMap.tif&#124;FocusTable.txt&#124;Label.tif&#124;MarkerList.txt&#124;OverviewBF.tif&#124;SampleMask.tif)</code> | ✓ | Required file from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. The optional files depend on which version of the PhenoCycler software was being used. |

| <code>lab_processed\/.*</code> | ✓ | Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/.*</code> | ✓ | This is a directory containing processed image files |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.tissue-boundary\.geojson</code> |  | **[QA/QC]** If the boundaries of the tissue have been identified (e.g., by manual efforts), then the boundary geometry can be included as a GeoJSON file named “*.tissue-boundary.geojson”. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff</code> | ✓ | OME-TIFF file (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm.
