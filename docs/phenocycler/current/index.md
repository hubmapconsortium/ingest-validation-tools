| pattern | required? | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <code>extras\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Folder for general lab-specific files related to the dataset. [Exists in all assays] |
| <code>extras\/microscope_hardware\.json</code> | ‚úì | **[QA/QC]** A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the hardware components of the microscope. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document. |
| <code>extras\/microscope_settings\.json</code> |  | **[QA/QC]** A file generated by the micro-meta app that contains a description of the settings that were used to acquire the image data. Email HuBMAP Consortium Help Desk <help@hubmapconsortium.org> if help is required in generating this document. |
| <code>raw\/.*</code> | ‚úì | This is a directory containing raw data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Raw image files. Using this subdirectory allows for harmonization with other more complex assays, like Visium that includes both raw imaging and sequencing data. |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.xpd</code> | ‚úì | Experimental set up of the Phenocycler-Fusion run. File includes cycle information, antibodies utilized, and the experimental design of the run |
| <code>raw\/images\/[^\/]+\.qptiff</code> | ‚úì | Final image file produced by the Phenocycler-Fusion |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/.*</code> | ‚úì | These are the files from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. The dataset should include all files from this directory except the "qptiff.intermediate" files. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/[^\/]+\.qptiff\.raw</code> | ‚úì | Raw image files from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/[^\/]+\.qptiff\.intermediate</code> |  | Intermediate image files from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. These files are not required. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/(?:CombineInputs.txt&#124;FocusMap.tif&#124;FocusTable.txt&#124;Label.tif&#124;MarkerList.txt&#124;OverviewBF.tif&#124;SampleMask.tif)</code> | ‚úì | Required file from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. The optional files depend on which version of the PhenoCycler software was being used. |
| <code>raw\/images\/phenocycler\/(?:CoverslipMask.tif&#124;FlowCellOverview.tif&#124;OverviewFL.tif&#124;SampleValMask.tif)</code> |  | Required file from the temp directory generated by the PhenoCycler. The optional files depend on which version of the PhenoCycler software was being used. |
| <code>lab_processed\/.*</code> | ‚úì | Experiment files that were processed by the lab generating the data. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/.*</code> | ‚úì | This is a directory containing processed image files |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.tissue-boundary\.geojson</code> |  | **[QA/QC]** If the boundaries of the tissue have been identified (e.g., by manual efforts), then the boundary geometry can be included as a GeoJSON file named ‚Äú*.tissue-boundary.geojson‚Äù. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]+\.ome\.tiff</code> | ‚úì | OME-TIFF file (multichannel, multi-layered) produced by the experiment. If compressed, must use loss-less compression algorithm. See the following link for the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0>. It is recommended that you confirm you're using the latest version of Bio-Formats, when generating the OME TIFF, as newer versions have improved XML handling. |
| <code>lab_processed\/images\/[^\/]*ome-tiff\.channels\.csv</code> | ‚úì | This file provides essential documentation pertaining to each channel of the accommpanying OME TIFF. The file should contain one row per OME TIFF channel. The required fields are detailed <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xEJSb0xn5C5fB3k62pj1CyHNybpt4-YtvUs5SUMS44o/edit#gid=0> |
