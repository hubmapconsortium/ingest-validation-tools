  description: 'The Kidney Donor Profle Index (KDPI) is a numerical measure that combines
    ten donor factors, including clinical parameters and demographics, to summarize
    into a single number the quality of deceased donor kidneys relative to other recovered
    kidneys. The KDPI is derived by frst calculating the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI)
    for a deceased donor. Kidneys from a donor with a KDPI of 90%, for example, have
    a KDRI (which indicates relative risk of graft failure) greater than 90% of recovered
    kidneys. The KDPI is simply a mapping of the KDRI from a relative risk scale to
    a cumulative percentage scale. The reference population used for this mapping
    is all deceased donors in the United States  with a kidney recovered for the purpose
    of transplantation in the prior calendar year.  Lower KDPI values are associated
    with increased donor quality and expected longevity. https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1512/guide_to_calculating_interpreting_kdpi.pdf
