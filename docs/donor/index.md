<a name="kidney_donor_profile_index_value"></a>
##### [`kidney_donor_profile_index_value`](#kidney_donor_profile_index_value)
The Kidney Donor Profle Index (KDPI) is a numerical measure that combines ten donor factors, including clinical parameters and demographics, to summarize into a single number the quality of deceased donor kidneys relative to other recovered kidneys. The KDPI is derived by frst calculating the Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) for a deceased donor. Kidneys from a donor with a KDPI of 90%, for example, have a KDRI (which indicates relative risk of graft failure) greater than 90% of recovered kidneys. The KDPI is simply a mapping of the KDRI from a relative risk scale to a cumulative percentage scale. The reference population used for this mapping is all deceased donors in the United States with a kidney recovered for the purpose of transplantation in the prior calendar year. Lower KDPI values are associated with increased donor quality and expected longevity. https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/media/1512/guide_to_calculating_interpreting_kdpi.pdf.
