  description: The concentration of the library which was submitted for sequencing.
    This field is different from the "library_final_yield" because the concentration
    field takes into account how the library was pooled with other libraries. The
    "library_final_yield" should be greater than or equal to this column. - TODO -
    Is this correct? This is a concentration, the other is a yield, typically in ng,
    so they don't seem to have the same units, so an inequality makes no sense.
