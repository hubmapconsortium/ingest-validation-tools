### `assay_category`
Each assay is placed into one of the following 3 general categories: generation of images of microscopic entities, identification & quantitation of molecules by mass spectrometry, and determination of nucleotide sequence.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| enum | `imaging` |
| required | `True` |

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |

### `acquisition_instrument_model`
Manufacturers of an acquisition instrument may offer various versions (models) of that instrument with different features or sensitivities. Differences in features or sensitivities may be relevant to processing or interpretation of the data.

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| required | `True` |

### `resolution_x_value`
The width of a pixel.

| constraint | value |

| constraint | value |
| --- | --- |
| enum | `nm` or `um` |

### `resolution_z_value`
Optional if assay does not have multiple z-levels. Note that this is resolution within a given sample: z-pitch (resolution_z_value) is the increment distance between image slices ie. the microscope stage is moved up or down in increments to capture images of several focal planes. The best one will be used & the rest discarded. The thickness of the sample itself is sample metadata. Leave blank if not applicable.
