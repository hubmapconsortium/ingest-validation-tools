description_md: 'CellDIVE uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay
  to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For CellDIVE, the `channel_id` is represented
  as a cycle#/channel# combination (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`) linked to a
  given image file in the directory.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more
  information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).'
