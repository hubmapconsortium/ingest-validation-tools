3D IMC submissions require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For 3D IMC, the `channel_id` is the name of the metal tag on the corresponding antibody.
The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).
