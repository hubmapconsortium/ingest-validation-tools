title: HuBMAP Data Upload Guidelines
---

Well-defined schemas ensure that HuBMAP data and metadata are reusable.
If you are starting work on a new assay type, review the
[guidelines for directory schemas](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/blob/master/HOWTO-describe-directories.md#readme).
If you have an upload prepared, follow the instructions in 
the [Metadata Validation Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfgiDGbyO4K4Hz1FMsJjmJd9RdwjShtJqFYNwKpbcZY/) 
document to validate your upload.

Assay types and their schemas are linked below.
- [An Excel file](field-schemas.xlsx) listing all the schemas and their fields is available.
- For more information, see the [`ingest-validation-tools` repo](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools#readme).

In 2023 the HuBMAP Consortium significantly revised and expanded our metadata specifications. Some specifications were deprecated, as part of these updates. The current and deprecated specifications have been separated below for clarity.
