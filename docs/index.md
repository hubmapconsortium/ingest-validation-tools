title: HuBMAP Data Upload Guidelines
---

Well-defined schemas ensure that HuBMAP data and metadata are reusable.
If you are starting work on a new assay type, review the
[guidelines for directory schemas](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools/blob/master/HOWTO-describe-directories.md#readme).
If you have an upload prepared, follow the instructions in 
the [Metadata Validation Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfgiDGbyO4K4Hz1FMsJjmJd9RdwjShtJqFYNwKpbcZY/) 
document to validate your upload.

Assay types and their schemas are linked below.
- [An Excel file](field-schemas.xlsx) listing all the schemas and their fields is available.
- For more information, see the [`ingest-validation-tools` repo](https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/ingest-validation-tools#readme).
