Prepare your metadata based on the latest metadata schema using one of the template files below. See the instructions in the [Metadata Validation Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lfgiDGbyO4K4Hz1FMsJjmJd9RdwjShtJqFYNwKpbcZY) document for more information on preparing and validating your metadata.tsv file prior to submission.

Related files:


- [üìù Excel template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hubmapconsortium/dataset-metadata-spreadsheet/main/visium-with-probes/latest/visium-with-probes.xlsx): For metadata entry.
- [üìù TSV template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hubmapconsortium/dataset-metadata-spreadsheet/main/visium-with-probes/latest/visium-with-probes.tsv): Alternative for metadata entry.


REQUIRED - For this assay, you must also prepare and submit two additional metadata.tsv files following the metadata schemas linked here for [RNAseq (with probes)](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/rnaseq-with-probes/current/) and [Histology](https://hubmapconsortium.github.io/ingest-validation-tools/histology/current/). [This link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YnmdTAA0Z9MKN3OjR3Sca8pz-LNQll91wdQoRPSP6Q4/edit#gid=0) lists the set of fields that are required in the OME TIFF file XML header.

| <code>raw\/[^\/]+\.gpr</code> | ‚úì | This is a 10X Genomics layout file that's generated by 10X and individualized for each Visium slide. This is a text file and can be generated using this 10X web form <https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/slidefile-download> along with the unique 10X Visium slide ID. |
| <code>raw\/additional_panels_used\.csv</code> |  | If multiple commercial probe panels were used, then the primary probe panel should be selected in the "oligo_probe_panel" metadata field. The additional panels must be included in this file. Each panel record should include:manufacturer, model/name, product code. |
| <code>raw\/custom_probe_set\.csv</code> |  | This file should contain any custom probes used and must be included if the metadata field "is_custom_probes_used" is "Yes". The file should minimally include:target gene id, probe seq, probe id. The contents of this file are modeled after the 10x Genomics probe set file (see <https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression-ffpe/probe-sets/probe-set-file-descriptions/probe-set-file-descriptions#probe_set_csv_file>). |
