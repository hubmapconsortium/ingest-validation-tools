description_md: 'CODEX uploads require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay
  to be provided in an Antibodies TSV. For CODEX, in that TSV, the `channel_id` is
  a cycle#/channel# combination linked to a given image file (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`).
  Each TIF file in a CODEX dataset contains image data captured from a single channel
  in a single cycle, identified and connected to the `channel_id` by its location
  in the upload directory (of the form `src_*/cyc*_reg*_*/*_*_Z*_CH*.tif`).

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more
  information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).'
