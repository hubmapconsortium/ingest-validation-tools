description_md: 'This schema is for CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX). CODEX uploads
  require metadata on the antibodies used in the assay to be provided in an Antibodies
  TSV. For CODEX, in that TSV, the `channel_id` is a cycle#/channel# combination linked
  to a given image file (of the form `Cycle[0-9]_CH[0-9]`). Each TIF file in a CODEX
  dataset contains image data captured from a single channel in a single cycle, identified
  and connected to the `channel_id` by its location in the upload directory (of the
  form `src_*/cyc*_reg*_*/*_*_Z*_CH*.tif`). For an example of a CODEX dataset & directory,
  see this example  [CODEX dataset](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/browse/dataset/053544cd63125fc25f6a71a8f444bafc#files)
  and click the Globus link.

  The other fields function the same way for all assays using antibodies. For more
  information, see the [Antibodies TSV documentation](../antibodies).'
